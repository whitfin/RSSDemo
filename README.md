Simple RSS Reader For Android
-------------------------------

I've seen a lot of examples of how to parse/read an RSS feed on Android into a `ListView`. Unfortunately, although the basics are there, a majority of these examples are either inefficient or badly coded/documented.

So, here is an example application which should teach you how to work with RSS feeds on Android. In the interest of helping, I've commented literally everything relevant to understanding what exactly is going on (it is a demo, after all).

It doesn't include anything flashy, but it's fairly simple to change to allow a user to input their desired feed, and to make it look better.

Simply place your feed URL inside the `RSSUtil` class, and try it out.
